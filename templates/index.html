        <p>
          Crustaceans are a diverse group of mostly aquatic invertebrate animals within the arthropods, traditionally classified under the subphylum Crustacea. They include crabs, lobsters, shrimp, barnacles, and many others. Crustaceans are now considered part of a larger group called Pancrustacea, which also includes insects, showing their close evolutionary relationship.

    <h1 style="font-size: 30px;">Pederson's shrimp</h1>
    <p><strong>Habitat:</strong> Lives symbiotically with sea anemones like <em>Bartholomea annulata</em> and <em>Condylactis gigantea</em>, offering cleaning services to fish.</p>
    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> Found in the Western Atlantic, including the Caribbean, Bermuda, Bahamas, and parts of South America.</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> A small, transparent shrimp (up to 3 cm) with bluish and violet markings and long white antennae.</p>
    <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Its transparency can be disrupted by exercise or stress, causing it to become opaque temporarily.</p>
    <p><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Plays a beneficial role in reef ecosystems by controlling ectoparasite populations on fish.</p>

  <div class="label">
    <h1 style="font-size: 30px;">Tropical rock lobster</h1>
    <p><strong>Habitat:</strong> The tropical rock lobster (Panulirus ornatus) lives in shallow coastal waters with sandy or rocky bottoms, often around coral reefs, up to depths of 50 metres.</p>
    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> It is found throughout the Indo-Pacific region, including northern Australia, Southeast Asia, and parts of the western Pacific Ocean.</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Panulirus ornatus has a colourful, spiny body with long antennae and no claws, growing up to 50 cm in length.</p>
    <p><strong>Fun facts:</strong> This lobster undertakes mass migrations across the sea floor and can live communally in crevices and under ledges.</p>
    <p><strong>Human Impact:</strong> It is heavily fished for its high market value, leading to concerns about overfishing and sustainability in some areas.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="label">
    <h1 style="font-size: 30px;">Barnacles</h1>
    <p><strong>Habitat:</strong> Barnacles attach themselves to hard surfaces like rocks, ships, whales, and piers, often found in intertidal zones down to 100 metres deep.</p>
    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> They are distributed worldwide in marine environments, from polar regions to tropical seas.</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Barnacles are small, hard-shelled crustaceans that live in calcareous plates and feed by filtering plankton with their feathery legs.</p>
    <p><strong>Fun facts:</strong> Barnacles begin life as free-swimming larvae before settling permanently on a surface, sometimes even on living animals.</p>
    <p><strong>Human Impact:</strong> They cause biofouling on ships and underwater structures, increasing drag and fuel use, but also contribute to marine ecosystems as filter feeders.</p>

  <div class="label">
    <h1 style="font-size: 30px;">Hermit crabs</h1>
    <p><strong>Habitat:</strong> Hermit crabs live on the seabed in sandy or muddy environments and hide in empty snail shells for protection, found down to depths of 150 metres.</p>
    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> They are common in coastal waters around the world, especially in temperate and tropical regions.</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Hermit crabs have soft, curved abdomens which they protect by occupying empty shells, with visible claws and long antennae.</p>
    <p><strong>Fun facts:</strong> When they outgrow their shells, hermit crabs search for larger ones and may even fight or queue for a better fit.</p>
    <p><strong>Human Impact:</strong> Coastal pollution and habitat disruption affect hermit crab populations, and they are sometimes collected for the pet trade.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="label">
    <h1 style="font-size: 30px;">copepods</h1>
    <p><strong>Habitat:</strong> Copepods live in nearly all aquatic environments, including oceans, freshwater lakes, rivers, and even damp soil.</p>
    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> They are found worldwide and are one of the most abundant metazoans on Earth by number.</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Copepods are tiny, shrimp-like crustaceans with a teardrop-shaped body, long antennae, and a segmented tail.</p>
    <p><strong>Fun facts:</strong> Some copepods can jump several times their body length and are a key part of the marine food web.</p>
    <p><strong>Human Impact:</strong> They are affected by water pollution and climate change, but also play a role in carbon cycling and water quality.</p>

  <div class="label">
    <h1 style="font-size: 30px;">Ice krill</h1>
    <p><strong>Habitat:</strong> Ice krill (Euphausia crystallorophias) live in cold Antarctic waters, often under sea ice and down to depths of 4,000 metres.</p>
    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> They are found exclusively in the Southern Ocean around Antarctica, especially near the continental shelf.</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Ice krill are small, transparent shrimp-like crustaceans with large black eyes and bioluminescent organs.</p>
    <p><strong>Fun facts:</strong> They can form dense swarms and are a major food source for fish, seals, penguins, and whales in Antarctic ecosystems.</p>
    <p><strong>Human Impact:</strong> Climate change and ice loss threaten their habitat, and krill fishing may disrupt food chains in the Southern Ocean.</p>
  </div>

    <div class="label">
    <h1 style="font-size: 30px;">Alicella gigantea</h1>
    <p><strong>Habitat:</strong> Alicella gigantea lives in deep-sea trenches, mainly at abyssal and hadal depths down to 8,931 metres.</p>
    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> Found in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and South West Pacific Oceans.</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> It is the largest known amphipod, with individuals reaching up to 34 cm in length.</p>
    <p><strong>Fun facts:</strong> This species shows abyssal gigantism, likely due to cold temperatures, low food, fewer predators, and high oxygen levels.</p>
    <p><strong>Human Impact:</strong> Despite its depth, it shows signs of pollution, with studies finding pesticides and heavy metals in its body.</p>
