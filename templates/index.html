        <p>
          Crustaceans are a diverse group of mostly aquatic invertebrate animals within the arthropods, traditionally classified under the subphylum Crustacea. They include crabs, lobsters, shrimp, barnacles, and many others. Crustaceans are now considered part of a larger group called Pancrustacea, which also includes insects, showing their close evolutionary relationship.

    <h1 style="font-size: 30px;">Pederson's shrimp</h1>
    <p><strong>Habitat:</strong> Lives symbiotically with sea anemones like <em>Bartholomea annulata</em> and <em>Condylactis gigantea</em>, offering cleaning services to fish.</p>
    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> Found in the Western Atlantic, including the Caribbean, Bermuda, Bahamas, and parts of South America.</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> A small, transparent shrimp (up to 3 cm) with bluish and violet markings and long white antennae.</p>
    <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Its transparency can be disrupted by exercise or stress, causing it to become opaque temporarily.</p>
    <p><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Plays a beneficial role in reef ecosystems by controlling ectoparasite populations on fish.</p>

    <h1 style="font-size: 30px;">Tropical rock lobster</h1>
    <p><strong>Habitat:</strong> The tropical rock lobster (Panulirus ornatus) lives in shallow coastal waters with sandy or rocky bottoms, often around coral reefs, up to depths of 50 metres.</p>
    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> It is found throughout the Indo-Pacific region, including northern Australia, Southeast Asia, and parts of the western Pacific Ocean.</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Panulirus ornatus has a colourful, spiny body with long antennae and no claws, growing up to 50 cm in length.</p>
    <p><strong>Fun facts:</strong> This lobster undertakes mass migrations across the sea floor and can live communally in crevices and under ledges.</p>
    <p><strong>Human Impact:</strong> It is heavily fished for its high market value, leading to concerns about overfishing and sustainability in some areas.</p>

  <div class="label">
    <h1 style="font-size: 30px;">Barnacles</h1>
    <p><strong>Habitat:</strong> Barnacles attach themselves to hard surfaces like rocks, ships, whales, and piers, often found in intertidal zones down to 100 metres deep.</p>
    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> They are distributed worldwide in marine environments, from polar regions to tropical seas.</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Barnacles are small, hard-shelled crustaceans that live in calcareous plates and feed by filtering plankton with their feathery legs.</p>
    <p><strong>Fun facts:</strong> Barnacles begin life as free-swimming larvae before settling permanently on a surface, sometimes even on living animals.</p>
    <p><strong>Human Impact:</strong> They cause biofouling on ships and underwater structures, increasing drag and fuel use, but also contribute to marine ecosystems as filter feeders.</p>
